Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain...

## Reqs

- Flutter must be installed on your system in order to build the client app.
- Build scripts are hardcoded to `windows-x64-embedder`, will be changed asap

## Setup

Run `setup.ps1`. It should cmake the things, and create a new flutter app boilerplate with the `main.dart` in this repo. It'll launch the SK host which should spin up the Dart VM and launch the flutter bundle.
